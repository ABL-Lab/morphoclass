## Janelia
This is a dataset of pyramidal cells obtained from Ying via Lida.

* Original path:
  `/gpfs/bbp.cscs.ch/data/project/proj78/janelia_oriented_for_rodrigo/WholeBrain/mouselight_isocortex_ASCII_Files`
* Some files had a lowercase extension ".asc", which was changed to upper case
  ".ASC" to match the rest of the files
* Based on the notes in both Excel-files a subset of morphology files was
  selected to compose a dataset. This dataset is represented by the file
  `selected_dataset.csv`.
